# TODO: Research WebAssembly Runtimes for ARM Microcontroller Support

**Priority**: ðŸŸ¡  
**Estimated Effort**: 3-5 days  
**Created**: 2024-12-19  
**Status**: Open  
**Completed**: 

## Problem Description

The 8f4e project currently supports browser-based WebAssembly runtimes (WebWorker and AudioWorklet) but lacks native runtimes for embedded ARM microcontrollers. To implement the planned microcontroller runtime and DaisyARMCortexM7 support, we need comprehensive research on available WebAssembly runtimes suitable for ARM-based embedded systems.

Current state:
- 8f4e compiles to WebAssembly bytecode designed for stack-based execution
- Browser runtimes exist but are limited to web environments
- Future plans include ARM Cortex-M7 support (DaisyARMCortexM7 runtime)
- The language has specific constraints: no runtime memory allocation, pre-planned memory layout, optimized for real-time audio processing

Impact:
- Without proper runtime selection, microcontroller implementation may be inefficient or infeasible
- Different runtimes have vastly different memory footprints and performance characteristics
- Wrong choice could limit target hardware compatibility or real-time performance requirements

## Proposed Solution

Conduct comprehensive research and evaluation of WebAssembly runtimes specifically for ARM microcontroller environments. Create a structured comparison matrix evaluating technical specifications, compatibility, and suitability for 8f4e's specific requirements.

High-level approach:
- Survey available WebAssembly runtimes for embedded systems
- Analyze hardware compatibility across ARM Cortex variants
- Evaluate memory footprint and performance characteristics
- Assess execution modes and their trade-offs
- Consider security features for embedded applications
- Provide recommendations based on 8f4e's specific needs

Key runtimes to evaluate:
1. **WAMR (WebAssembly Micro Runtime)** - Intel's lightweight runtime
2. **Wasm3** - Ultra-lightweight interpreter
3. **WasmEdge/Wasmtime/Wasmer** - Full-featured runtimes for Linux ARM
4. **WaTZ** - ARM TrustZone-enabled secure execution

Alternative approaches considered:
- Custom WebAssembly interpreter implementation (high effort, not recommended)
- Transpilation to native ARM code (loses WebAssembly portability benefits)
- Hybrid approach using multiple runtimes for different use cases

## Implementation Plan

### Step 1: Runtime Discovery and Initial Assessment
- Compile comprehensive list of available WebAssembly runtimes for embedded systems
- Identify additional runtimes beyond the four specified (e.g., Wasmtime-embedded, micro-wasm)
- Document basic characteristics: license, maintenance status, community support
- Expected outcome: Complete inventory of candidate runtimes
- Dependencies: None

### Step 2: Hardware Compatibility Analysis
- Research ARM Cortex-M compatibility (M0, M0+, M3, M4, M7) for each runtime
- Analyze ARM Cortex-A compatibility and differences from Cortex-M
- Investigate TrustZone support and security implications
- Document minimum hardware requirements (RAM, Flash, CPU features)
- Expected outcome: Hardware compatibility matrix
- Dependencies: Step 1

### Step 3: Memory and Performance Benchmarking
- Analyze binary size requirements for each runtime
- Document heap memory requirements and allocation patterns
- Research execution performance characteristics (interpreter vs AOT vs JIT)
- Evaluate startup time and memory initialization overhead
- Compare against 8f4e's constraint of no runtime memory allocation
- Expected outcome: Performance and memory usage comparison table
- Dependencies: Step 2

### Step 4: Execution Modes and Features Analysis
- Document available execution modes (interpreter, AOT compilation, JIT compilation)
- Analyze trade-offs between modes (size vs speed vs complexity)
- Research debugging and profiling capabilities
- Investigate integration APIs and host function support
- Evaluate real-time performance characteristics for audio applications
- Expected outcome: Feature comparison matrix
- Dependencies: Step 3

### Step 5: Embedded Systems Suitability Assessment
- Evaluate power consumption characteristics
- Analyze deterministic execution capabilities for real-time applications
- Research integration with RTOS and bare-metal environments
- Document toolchain requirements and cross-compilation support
- Assess ease of integration with existing ARM development workflows
- Expected outcome: Embedded suitability analysis
- Dependencies: Step 4

### Step 6: Security and TrustZone Evaluation
- Research WaTZ and other secure WebAssembly execution environments
- Analyze ARM TrustZone integration capabilities
- Evaluate isolation and sandboxing features
- Document security model implications for embedded applications
- Expected outcome: Security features comparison
- Dependencies: Step 1-5

### Step 7: 8f4e-Specific Requirements Analysis
- Map 8f4e's technical requirements to runtime capabilities
- Analyze compatibility with stack-oriented execution model
- Evaluate support for 8f4e's memory layout constraints
- Research audio processing and real-time requirements alignment
- Consider integration complexity with existing codebase
- Expected outcome: 8f4e compatibility assessment
- Dependencies: All previous steps

### Step 8: Recommendations and Decision Matrix
- Create weighted decision matrix based on 8f4e's priorities
- Provide primary and alternative runtime recommendations
- Document implementation complexity estimates for each option
- Suggest prototype development approach for selected runtime(s)
- Expected outcome: Final research report with clear recommendations
- Dependencies: All previous steps

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Complete inventory of available WebAssembly runtimes for ARM embedded systems
- [ ] Hardware compatibility matrix covering ARM Cortex-M, Cortex-A, and TrustZone
- [ ] Memory and performance benchmark comparison table
- [ ] Feature analysis covering execution modes, debugging, and integration APIs
- [ ] Embedded systems suitability assessment for each runtime
- [ ] Security and TrustZone capabilities evaluation
- [ ] 8f4e-specific compatibility analysis
- [ ] Weighted decision matrix with clear recommendations
- [ ] Prototype development roadmap for recommended runtime(s)

## Affected Components

- Future `packages/runtime-arm-cortex-m7/` - Will be implemented based on research findings
- Future `packages/runtime-linux-arm/` - May benefit from Linux-compatible runtime research
- `packages/compiler/` - May need adjustments based on runtime-specific requirements
- `docs/` - Should be updated with runtime compatibility information
- Development toolchain - May need updates for cross-compilation support

## Risks & Considerations

- **Risk 1**: Limited documentation or community support for embedded WebAssembly runtimes
  - Mitigation: Focus on well-maintained runtimes with active communities, consider multiple options
- **Risk 2**: Performance characteristics may not meet real-time audio requirements
  - Mitigation: Include performance benchmarking in research, consider hybrid approaches
- **Risk 3**: Memory constraints of target microcontrollers may be too restrictive
  - Mitigation: Evaluate ultra-lightweight options like Wasm3, document minimum hardware requirements
- **Risk 4**: Integration complexity may be higher than anticipated
  - Mitigation: Include integration assessment in research, consider proof-of-concept implementations
- **Dependencies**: Research depends on availability of documentation and test environments
- **Breaking Changes**: None expected for research phase, but findings may influence future architecture decisions
