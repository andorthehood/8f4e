|----|-------|----------|--------|---------|---------|
| 053 | Fix Runtime Reinitialization on Code Change | ðŸ”´ | 4-6h | 2025-09-03 | Runtime destroys and recreates completely on every code change instead of syncing existing instance, causing audio glitches, performance degradation, and loss of runtime state |

### ðŸŸ¡ Medium Priority

| ID | Title | Priority | Effort | Created | Summary |
|----|-------|----------|--------|---------|---------|
| 002 | Enable Strict TypeScript in Editor Package | ðŸŸ¡ | 2-3d | 2025-08-23 | Currently has 52 type errors when strict settings enabled, causing missing null checks and implicit any types that reduce type safety and developer experience |
| 025 | Separate Editor View Layer into Standalone Package | ðŸŸ¡ | 3-5d | 2025-08-26 | Extract Canvas-based rendering and sprite management into `@8f4e/browser-view` package to make core editor a pure state machine compatible with any renderer |

| 055 | Implement Strength Reduction Compiler Optimization | ðŸŸ¡ | 2-3d | 2025-09-08 | No optimization for patterns like `x * 2` â†’ `x << 1`; missing performance gains from replacing expensive multiplication/division with bit shifts |
| 056 | Add One-Time Init Blocks Language Feature | ðŸŸ¡ | 5-7d | 2025-09-09 | No language construct for one-time initialization; init code runs repeatedly in main loop with manual guards, causing inefficiency and potential bugs |

| 059 | Refactor Unit Tests into __tests__ Folders | ðŸŸ¡ | 0.5-1d | 2025-09-04 | Inconsistent test organization makes discovery harder and complicates refactors; standardize to `packages/<pkg>/src/**/__tests__/*.test.ts` structure |
| 062 | Editor Command Queue Refactor | ðŸŸ¡ | 3-4d | 2025-10-09 | Direct callback storage makes state non-serializable and couples effects to host functions; replace with typed command queue for better testability and side-effect observability |
