# TODO: Complete MIDI Functionality Testing Coverage

**Priority**: 🟢
**Estimated Effort**: 1 day
**Created**: 2025-08-27
**Status**: Open
**Completed**: 

## Problem Description

The MIDI functionality (`packages/editor/src/midi/`) has partial test coverage with only `ccNames.test.ts` implemented. The MIDI system includes:

- CC Names mapping (`ccNames.ts`) - ✓ Already tested
- MIDI enumerations (`enums.ts`) - ❌ Not tested
- MIDI integration and event handling - ❌ Limited testing

Complete MIDI testing is needed to ensure MIDI functionality works correctly across different MIDI devices and scenarios.

## Proposed Solution

Complete the MIDI testing coverage by:
- Adding comprehensive tests for `enums.ts`
- Expanding `ccNames.test.ts` if needed
- Adding integration tests for MIDI event handling
- Testing MIDI device interaction patterns
- Adding edge case and error handling tests

## Implementation Plan

### Step 1: MIDI Enums Testing
- Create comprehensive tests for `enums.ts`
- Test all MIDI constants and enumerations
- Verify enum values match MIDI standard
- Expected outcome: Complete coverage of MIDI constants

### Step 2: Expand CC Names Testing
- Review existing `ccNames.test.ts` for completeness
- Add any missing test cases for CC name mappings
- Test edge cases and invalid CC numbers
- Expected outcome: Robust CC names testing

### Step 3: MIDI Integration Testing
- Test MIDI event handling integration
- Test MIDI device connection/disconnection scenarios
- Test MIDI message parsing and processing
- Expected outcome: MIDI integration works reliably

### Step 4: Error Handling and Edge Cases
- Test invalid MIDI messages
- Test MIDI device error scenarios
- Test MIDI system under stress conditions
- Expected outcome: Robust MIDI error handling

## Success Criteria

- [ ] `enums.ts` has comprehensive test coverage
- [ ] CC names testing is complete and robust
- [ ] MIDI integration scenarios are tested
- [ ] MIDI error handling is thoroughly tested
- [ ] Test coverage >95% for midi directory
- [ ] All tests pass and run quickly (<500ms total)

## Affected Components

- `packages/editor/src/midi/enums.ts` - Create comprehensive test file
- `packages/editor/src/midi/ccNames.test.ts` - Review and expand if needed
- MIDI integration points with state and events systems
- Mock MIDI device interfaces for testing

## Risks & Considerations

- **MIDI Device Dependencies**: Testing MIDI without actual devices requires good mocking
- **Browser Compatibility**: MIDI functionality varies across browsers, may need compatibility testing
- **MIDI Standard Compliance**: Tests should verify compliance with MIDI standards
- **Low Priority**: MIDI is working and partially tested, so this is lower priority than other areas

## Related Items

- **Blocks**: None currently
- **Depends on**: Jest configuration (already set up)
- **Related**: TODO-032 (main test coverage plan), existing ccNames.test.ts

## Notes

- MIDI testing is the smallest and most contained of all testing areas
- Existing ccNames.test.ts provides a good pattern to follow
- Consider using MIDI test fixtures for complex scenarios
- Mock Web MIDI API for browser-independent testing
- Focus on MIDI message handling logic rather than browser MIDI API integration
- This is a good starting point for someone new to the codebase
