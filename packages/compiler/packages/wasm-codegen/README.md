# @8f4e/wasm-codegen

WebAssembly code generation for 8f4e.

This package owns bytecode emission, instruction compilers, WebAssembly local storage, function bodies, initial memory data segments, memory-import sizing, and final section assembly.

Module and function emitters consume resolved executable bodies and stack-analysis facts. Function signatures, imports, exports, expanded parameters, and module execution directives arrive as metadata. Declaration instructions do not enter the instruction dispatcher.

Codegen assigns WebAssembly indexes to source binding identities, placing parameters first, and allocates its own temporary locals for loops, maps, clamps, and memory guards. Source names do not participate in storage lookup. Allocating a later source local cannot change which binding an earlier instruction references, and generated temporary names cannot shadow source bindings.

Source ASTs remain attached to compiled output for tooling and diagnostics. Codegen does not replay those ASTs, resolve source references, validate syntax, repeat stack analysis, or decide compiler pass ordering.

Target-independent semantic helpers belong in `@8f4e/semantic-utils`. Language constants and instruction metadata belong in `@8f4e/language-spec`.
