# Project Preparser Package Guidelines

This file extends the root and compiler package guidance for `packages/compiler/packages/project-preparser`.

## Package Scope

- Package name: `@8f4e/project-preparser`.
- Source lives in `src/`; output lives in `dist/`.
- Owns parsing raw `.8f4e` project source into the compiler-owned `ProjectObjectModel` and resolving project includes
  for the compiler facade.
- Does not know about editor state, grid positioning, rendering, browser storage, or VS Code/webview state.
- Does not load include files itself. Callers provide an async `resolveInclude` function so node, browser, editor, and test environments can load includes however they need.
- Groups are project organization metadata referencing canonical block ids and are ignored by compilation.

## Commands

- From the repo root, prefer Nx:
  - `npx nx run @8f4e/project-preparser:test`
  - `npx nx run @8f4e/project-preparser:typecheck`
  - `npx nx run @8f4e/project-preparser:lint`
  - `npx nx run @8f4e/project-preparser:build`

## Architecture

- Pipeline: raw project source -> classified `ProjectObjectModel` collections.
- `@8f4e/language-spec` is the sole owner of project object-model types; do not define parallel project contracts here.
- Do not lower a project into a second whole-project compiler input. Private compiler stages consume the canonical
  collections directly.
- Include source is resolved behind `compileProject` and passed to private compiler stages as derived functions.
- Keep compiler diagnostics block-relative. If project-level preparation reports an error from inside a block, attach the project block id and use the line number within that block.
