# TODO: Lazy Load Examples (Projects & Modules)

## Problem Description

Currently, all example projects and modules are imported synchronously in `src/examples/index.ts`, which means they are loaded upfront even when users don't need them. This increases the initial bundle size and startup time, especially as the example library grows.

**Current State**: All example projects and modules are statically imported and bundled together.

**Why this is a problem**: 
- Example content increases initial bundle size unnecessarily
- Users who don't use examples still pay the bundle cost
- Startup time is slower due to parsing unused example code
- Memory usage is higher even for inactive examples
- Scaling issues as the example library grows

**Impact**: Larger initial bundle size, slower startup, and suboptimal memory usage for users who don't immediately need examples.

## Proposed Solution

**High-level approach**: Implement lazy loading for examples with different strategies for projects vs modules:
- **Example Modules**: Load all modules in one batch when examples are first accessed
- **Example Projects**: Load individual projects only when opened/selected

**Key changes required**:
- Replace static imports with dynamic imports for examples
- Implement batch loading for example modules
- Add lazy loading for individual example projects
- Create example registry with metadata and loader functions
- Add loading states for example access

**Alternative approaches considered**:
- Load everything on demand (rejected - would cause delays when browsing examples)
- Load examples based on user preferences (rejected - adds complexity without clear benefit)

## Implementation Plan

### Step 1: Create Example Registry
- Create `src/examples/registry.ts` with metadata and loader functions
- Define example project and module structures
- Add type definitions for example loaders
- **Expected outcome**: Centralized example management system
- **Dependencies**: None

### Step 2: Refactor Example Modules Loading
- Replace static imports in `src/examples/modules/index.ts`
- Implement batch loading for all modules when first accessed
- Add loading state management for module batch loading
- **Expected outcome**: Modules load in one batch when needed
- **Dependencies**: Step 1 completion

### Step 3: Implement Project Lazy Loading
- Replace static imports in `src/examples/projects/index.ts`
- Add individual project loading functions
- Implement project metadata without full content loading
- **Expected outcome**: Projects load individually when opened
- **Dependencies**: Step 2 completion

### Step 4: Update Example Access Points
- Modify example browser/selector components
- Add loading states for example access
- Implement smooth transitions for loaded examples
- **Expected outcome**: Seamless example browsing experience
- **Dependencies**: Step 3 completion

### Step 5: Testing and Optimization
- Test example loading performance
- Verify bundle size reduction
- Test example switching and loading scenarios
- **Expected outcome**: Verified lazy loading with performance improvements
- **Dependencies**: All previous steps

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Initial bundle size reduced by removing example content
- [ ] Example modules load in one batch when first accessed
- [ ] Example projects load individually when opened
- [ ] Example browsing experience remains smooth
- [ ] Loading states provide clear feedback during example access
- [ ] All existing example functionality preserved

## Affected Components

- `src/examples/index.ts` - Main examples entry point
- `src/examples/modules/index.ts` - Example modules index
- `src/examples/projects/index.ts` - Example projects index
- `src/examples/registry.ts` - New example registry (to be created)
- Example browser/selector components (to be identified)

## Risks & Considerations

- **Bundle splitting**: Vite configuration may need updates for optimal example chunking
- **Loading delays**: First access to examples will have a loading delay
- **User experience**: Need to balance lazy loading with smooth browsing
- **Dependencies**: No external dependencies, but requires careful testing
- **Breaking Changes**: None expected - maintains existing example functionality

## Related Items

- **Blocks**: None currently
- **Depends on**: None (can be implemented independently)
- **Related**: TODO: 015 (Lazy Load Runtimes), performance optimization initiatives

## Notes

- This work can be implemented independently of the runtime lazy loading
- Focus on maintaining smooth example browsing experience
- Consider implementing example metadata display before full loading
- Example modules batch loading provides good balance of performance vs UX
- Individual project loading ensures minimal memory usage for unused examples
