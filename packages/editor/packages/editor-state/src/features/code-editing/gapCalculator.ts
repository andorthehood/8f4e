/**
 * Calculates the physical row index by adding the size of every gap that starts before the logical row.
 * Gaps are produced by `features/code-blocks/gaps.ts` to insert additional blank rows after a line
 * whenever a decoration (plot/piano visualizers or compilation errors) needs vertical space in the
 * rendered block. Each entry stores how many extra rows were spliced into `codeToRender` after that
 * logical line, so downstream consumers must translate logical line numbers into physical rows before
 * turning them into pixel coordinates.
 * @param row Logical row within the editor before accounting for the inserted gap rows.
 * @param gaps Gap metadata keyed by logical row whose size indicates the number of additional rows inserted.
 * @returns The adjusted physical row that includes the cumulative gap offsets.
