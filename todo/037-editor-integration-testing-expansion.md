# TODO: Expand Editor Integration Testing Coverage

**Priority**: ðŸŸ¡
**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 days
**Created**: 2025-08-27
**Status**: Open

The integration testing directory (`packages/editor/src/integration/`) currently has minimal coverage with only `featureFlags.test.ts` implemented. Integration testing is critical for ensuring that different editor subsystems work together correctly. Missing integration testing includes:

- Cross-component workflows between state, events, and effects
- Data flow integration between different editor subsystems
- Pure logic workflows and transformations
- Error propagation and recovery across components
- Performance characteristics of integrated systems

Without comprehensive integration testing, subtle bugs can arise when components interact, especially during refactoring efforts.

## Proposed Solution

Expand integration testing to cover:
- Core logic flows between major editor components
- State management integration with effects and events
- Error handling and recovery across component boundaries
- Data transformation pipelines and workflows
- Performance and reliability of integrated systems


## Implementation Plan

### Step 1: State-Effects Integration Testing
- Test state changes triggering appropriate effects
- Test effect chains and dependencies
- Test state consistency during effect execution
- Expected outcome: State and effects work reliably together

### Step 2: Events-State Integration Testing
- Test event handling updating state correctly
- Test state changes emitting appropriate events
- Test event flow through the system
- Expected outcome: Events and state are properly integrated

### Step 3: Cross-Component Workflow Testing
- Test complete workflows spanning multiple components
- Test data transformation pipelines
- Test error propagation across component boundaries
- Expected outcome: Components work together in realistic scenarios

### Step 4: Performance and Reliability Testing
- Test integration performance characteristics
- Test system behavior under load
- Test recovery from error conditions
- Expected outcome: Integrated system is performant and reliable

### Step 5: Expand Existing Integration Tests
- Review and expand `featureFlags.test.ts`
- Add more comprehensive integration scenarios
- Test feature flag effects on integrated workflows
- Expected outcome: Feature flag integration is thoroughly tested

## Success Criteria

- [ ] State-effects integration is comprehensively tested
- [ ] Events-state integration scenarios are covered
- [ ] Cross-component workflows are tested
- [ ] Error propagation and recovery is tested
- [ ] Performance characteristics are validated
- [ ] Existing feature flags integration is expanded
- [ ] Test coverage >85% for integration scenarios
- [ ] All tests pass and run efficiently (<3 seconds total)

## Affected Components

- `packages/editor/src/integration/featureFlags.test.ts` - Expand existing tests
- New integration test files for state-effects workflows
- New integration test files for events-state coordination
- Cross-component workflow test scenarios
- Performance and reliability test suites

## Risks & Considerations

- **Test Complexity**: Integration tests can become complex and hard to maintain
- **Mock Management**: Integration testing requires careful mock coordination
- **Test Performance**: Large integration test suites can slow down development
- **Component Dependencies**: Changes to individual components may break integration tests
- **Scope Creep**: Integration testing can easily expand beyond manageable scope

## Related Items

- **Blocks**: Future refactoring efforts depend on this safety net
- **Depends on**: Component-level testing (state effects, events, etc.)
- **Related**: TODO-032 (main test coverage plan), TODO-033 (state effects), TODO-034 (events)

- [Events System](packages/editor/src/events/)

## Notes

- Start with simple integration scenarios before tackling complex workflows
- Use existing featureFlags.test.ts as a pattern for integration testing
- Focus on pure logic integration, avoid DOM-dependent testing
- Consider creating integration test utilities for common scenarios
- Keep integration tests focused on component interactions, not implementation details
- Integration tests should complement, not duplicate, unit tests
- Performance testing should focus on integration bottlenecks
- This testing area requires good understanding of editor architecture
