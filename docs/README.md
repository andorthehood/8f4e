# Introduction to 8f4e

8f4e is a stack oriented programming language with a visual code editor that I created to perform generative music at algorave events.

Its primary target is the WebAssembly virtual machine, as I wanted an efficient yet portable tool for real time audio signal generation and processing.

## Stack Oriented Execution Model

Stack oriented programming means that, instead of using registers, instructions take their operands from a stack and push their results back onto the same stack for the next instruction.

I chose this programming paradigm because the WebAssembly virtual machine is itself a stack machine.

Staying native to this execution model avoids costly abstractions and makes it possible to build a simpler and faster compiler.

```
push 2
push 3
; Pushing values 2 and 3 onto the stack
add
; After executing the add instruction,
; the stack will contain the value 5

push 10
mul
; Now the stack will contain the value 50

push 10
div
; Now 5 again
```

The full instruction set reference lives alongside the compiler docs. See [Instruction Reference](../packages/compiler/docs/instructions.md).

## Memory Access and Pointers

It is also possible to take values from the stack and store them in memory.
For identifier prefixes and suffixes that expand memory identifiers, see [Identifier prefixes](../packages/compiler/docs/prefixes.md).

The language uses C style pointer notation.

```
int result

push &result
push 42
store
; The store instruction takes two values:
; a memory address and the value to store
```

## Endless Execution Loop

Programs in 8f4e run inside an endless loop. This reflects how real time audio systems operate, where processing consists of continuously reading from and writing to audio buffers.

8f4e removes this control flow boilerplate and allows programs to focus purely on signal generation and transformation.

## Memory Layout and Allocation

8f4e programs run inside a sandboxed, contiguous memory space. All variables are laid out sequentially within this space, so variables declared one after another occupy adjacent memory locations.

```
int a 1
int b 1
; Memory address of b is a + word size
int c 1
; Memory address of c is b + word size
```

Memory addresses are determined entirely at compile time — dynamic memory allocation is not supported. Developers must plan their program's memory needs up front during coding.

Because all addresses are known at compile time, the compiler can inline them directly into memory operation instructions, avoiding any runtime address resolution overhead.

## Modules and Execution Order

The code is organized into modules, each containing variable declarations and a sequence of commands.

The execution order of modules is determined by their dependencies. If a module’s output is needed as input for others, it is executed first.

```
module foo

int a 10
int b 20
int result

push &result
push a
push b
add
store
moduleEnd
```

## Live Variable Editing

8f4e supports real time manual modification of variable values while the program is running, without requiring recompilation. This is made possible by the deterministic allocation strategy: because memory addresses are fixed at compile time, the compiler can provide the exact address of every memory item, allowing the editor to locate and update any variable directly in memory without restarting or recompiling the program.

```
int foo 10
; You can change these values in the editor
; while the program is running
int bar 20
; The editor traces them back in memory
; and updates their values without restarting
; or recompiling the program
```

## Visibility and Memory Safety

All variables in 8f4e are public. There is no concept of variable visibility.

Memory safety is optional. Raw pointers can reference any location within the program's memory space, the visual wires help developers see where pointers are pointing.

When you want checked addressing, use address-aware values such as `&foo`, keep pointer arithmetic within the proven safe range, or explicitly clamp the address with `clampAddress`, `clampModuleAddress`, or `clampGlobalAddress` before loading or storing.

The compiler tracks proven safe address ranges where it can. Load and store instructions can omit runtime guards when the address is known to be safe; otherwise they emit guarded memory access. 

Memory items are allocated on a 32-bit grid — every memory item starts at an address that is a multiple of 4 bytes.

```
int* pointer

push &pointer
push pointer
push 4
add
store

; pointer will iterate through all
; possible memory addresses
```
