# TODO: Fix Color Scheme Persistence Bug

**Priority**: ðŸŸ¡
**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 hours
**Created**: 2025-10-17 
**Status**: Completed
**Completed**: 2025-10-17

## Problem Description

When users change the color scheme in the editor, the selection is not properly persisted or restored. The issue manifests as:

- Color scheme changes appear to work immediately in the UI
- However, when the browser is reloaded, the editor reverts to the default color scheme ('hackerman') instead of the user's selected scheme
- The color scheme setting is not being saved to localStorage or not being loaded correctly on initialization
- This creates a poor user experience where preferences are lost on every page refresh

## Proposed Solution

Investigate and fix the color scheme persistence mechanism by ensuring:

1. **Verification of Save Process**: Confirm that `setColorScheme` events properly trigger the `saveProject` event and that editor settings are being saved to localStorage
2. **Verification of Load Process**: Ensure that saved editor settings are properly loaded during initialization and applied to the state
3. **Load Order Fix**: Check if there's a race condition between loading color schemes and loading editor settings that causes the default to override the saved setting
4. **State Initialization**: Verify that the editor settings are properly initialized with saved values rather than defaults

## Implementation Plan

### Step 1: Debug Save Process
- Add console logging to verify `setColorScheme` events trigger `saveProject`
- Verify that `saveEditorSettingsToStorage` is called with correct data
- Check localStorage to confirm settings are actually being written

### Step 2: Debug Load Process  
- Add console logging to verify `loadEditorSettingsFromStorage` returns saved data
- Check the order of operations in the loader effect
- Verify that saved settings override default state

### Step 3: Fix Load Order Issues
- Ensure editor settings are loaded after color schemes are available
- Make sure saved color scheme is applied after both are loaded
- Handle case where saved color scheme doesn't exist in available schemes

### Step 4: Add Error Handling
- Add proper error handling for storage operations
- Fallback gracefully when saved settings are invalid
- Log warnings when expected data is missing

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Color scheme selection persists across browser reloads
- [ ] Saved color scheme is properly loaded and applied on initialization
- [ ] No race conditions between loading color schemes and editor settings
- [ ] Proper error handling for storage operations
- [ ] Console logging shows correct save/load operations

## Affected Components

- `packages/editor/src/state/effects/colorTheme.ts` - Color scheme state management
- `packages/editor/src/state/effects/loader.ts` - Settings loading and saving logic
- `src/storage-callbacks.ts` - localStorage persistence implementation
- `src/editor.ts` - Editor initialization and callback setup

## Risks & Considerations

- **Race Condition Risk**: Color schemes and editor settings loading order may cause timing issues
- **Data Validation**: Need to ensure saved color scheme exists in available schemes
- **Backward Compatibility**: Changes should not break existing saved settings
- **Performance**: Additional logging should not impact performance

## Notes

- The issue appears to be in the persistence layer rather than the UI layer
- Color scheme changes work immediately, suggesting the state update is correct
- The problem is likely in the save/load cycle or initialization order
- May be related to recent changes in TODO 060 (lazy loading color schemes)
