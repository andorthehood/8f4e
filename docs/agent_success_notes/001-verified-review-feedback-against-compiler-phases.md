# Agent Success Note - Verified review feedback against compiler phases

## Short Summary

The agent rejected an invalid review suggestion after verifying it against the current compiler pipeline. This preserved the tokenizer, semantic normalization, and codegen phase boundaries instead of adding a defensive patch in the wrong layer.

## Original Feedback

A review comment suggested changing `getClampAccessByteWidth` in `packages/compiler/src/utils/addressClamp.ts` so present-but-non-literal clamp width arguments would throw `SyntaxRulesError` instead of defaulting.

At first glance this looked plausible because `getClampAccessByteWidth` contains:

```ts
const value = argument?.type === ArgumentType.LITERAL ? argument.value : DEFAULT_ACCESS_BYTE_WIDTH;
```

If called directly with a non-literal argument, that expression would use the default width.

## Verification

The agent checked the actual compiler path before editing:

- The tokenizer intentionally accepts compile-time clamp width arguments such as `sizeof(buffer)`.
- Semantic normalization resolves those compile-time arguments into literals before codegen.
- The clamp instruction compilers are wrapped in `withValidation`.
- `withValidation` rejects non-literal clamp arguments before `getClampAccessByteWidth` runs.

So the apparent fallback was not reachable through the normal compiler entry points.

## Correct Pushback

The agent did not apply the suggested `SyntaxRulesError` change because that would have been the wrong error domain. By the time `addressClamp.ts` runs, the compiler is past raw syntax validation; failures there belong to semantic/compiler errors unless the tokenizer itself can detect them from token shape alone.

The correct response was to leave the code unchanged and explain why the review finding was invalid as written.

## Success Pattern

Verify review feedback against the current pipeline and ownership boundaries before implementing it.

This is rare enough to document explicitly. AI coding agents often comply with review comments too quickly, especially when a review agent asks for another validation every time a variable is passed into another function. That can turn into an infinite loop of redundant checks: one agent requests defensive validation at each boundary, and the coding agent adds it because it wants to satisfy the user or reviewer rather than challenge the premise.

In this case, the better behavior was to pause and verify whether the requested validation already existed at the correct phase.

## Reusable Principle

Do not add defensive checks in a downstream compiler phase just because a lower-level helper can be miscalled in isolation. First verify whether upstream syntax validation, semantic normalization, and instruction validation already enforce the invariant. If they do, preserve the staged contract instead of duplicating checks in the wrong layer.
