# TODO: Fix npm ls Errors

**Priority**: ðŸ”´  
**Estimated Effort**: 30 minutes  
**Created**: 2024-12-19  
**Status**: Completed  

## Problem Description

The project exhibits numerous `npm ls` errors when running dependency analysis, showing "UNMET DEPENDENCY" messages for all workspace packages and devDependencies. This occurs when the repository is freshly cloned and dependencies haven't been installed.

**Current npm ls error output:**
```bash
$ npm ls
npm error code ELSPROBLEMS
npm error missing: @8f4e/2d-engine@file:/home/runner/work/8f4e/8f4e/packages/2d-engine, required by 8f4e@1.0.0

[... and many more UNMET DEPENDENCY errors]
```

**Root causes identified:**
- **Missing node_modules**: No `npm install` has been run after cloning
- **Workspace packages not linked**: NPM workspaces require proper installation to create symlinks
- **DevDependencies not installed**: All build tools and development dependencies are missing

## Proposed Solution

The solution is straightforward: run `npm install` to properly install all dependencies and set up workspace linking. This will:

1. **Install all devDependencies** listed in the root package.json
2. **Set up workspace symlinks** for all @8f4e/* packages
3. **Create proper dependency tree** that npm ls can validate
4. **Enable development workflow** with all tools available

## Implementation Plan

### Step 1: Run npm install
- Execute `npm install` in the root directory
- Allow npm to install all devDependencies and workspace packages
- Verify no installation errors occur
- Expected outcome: Complete dependency installation and workspace setup

### Step 2: Verify npm ls output
- Run `npm ls` to confirm all dependencies are properly resolved
- Check that workspace packages show as symlinked (-> ./packages/*)
- Verify no UNMET DEPENDENCY errors remain
- Expected outcome: Clean npm ls output with dependency tree

### Step 3: Validate workspace functionality
- Confirm all @8f4e/* packages are properly linked
- Test that cross-package imports work correctly
- Verify build tools and development dependencies are accessible
- Expected outcome: Fully functional development environment

## Success Criteria

- [x] `npm install` completes successfully without errors
- [x] `npm ls` shows clean dependency tree with no UNMET DEPENDENCY errors
- [x] All workspace packages appear as symlinks (-> ./packages/*)
- [x] All devDependencies are properly installed and accessible
- [x] Development workflow (build, test, lint) functions correctly
- [x] Cross-package imports resolve correctly

## Affected Components

- **Root node_modules/** - Created with all dependencies
- **Workspace packages** - All @8f4e/* packages properly symlinked
- **DevDependencies** - All build tools, linters, and test frameworks installed
- **Package linking** - NPM workspace symlinks established
- **Development workflow** - Build scripts, testing, and linting enabled

## Risks & Considerations

- **Risk 1**: Network connectivity issues during npm install
  - Mitigation: Ensure stable internet connection, retry if needed
- **Risk 2**: Version conflicts in dependency resolution
  - Mitigation: Current package.json appears well-maintained with compatible versions
- **Risk 3**: Platform-specific dependency issues
  - Mitigation: Dependencies used are cross-platform compatible
- **Dependencies**: None - this is typically the first step after cloning
- **Breaking Changes**: None - this is standard dependency installation

## Related Items

- **Enables**: All other development tasks and TODOs
- **Prerequisite for**: Build processes, testing, linting, and development workflow
- **Related**: General project setup and onboarding documentation

## Notes

- This is a fundamental setup step that should be performed immediately after cloning
- The npm ls errors are expected behavior when dependencies haven't been installed
- NPM workspaces require proper installation to create package symlinks
- Consider adding this step to project README or setup documentation
- All subsequent development tasks depend on this basic setup being completed

## Completion Summary

**Completed**: 2024-12-19

Successfully resolved all npm ls errors by running `npm install`. The command completed without issues and properly:

1. âœ… **Installed all devDependencies**: All build tools, linters, and development packages installed
2. âœ… **Set up workspace linking**: All @8f4e/* packages now properly symlinked
3. âœ… **Resolved dependency tree**: npm ls now shows clean output with no errors
4. âœ… **Enabled development workflow**: Build, test, and lint commands now functional
5. âœ… **Created proper node_modules**: Full dependency tree established

The fix was straightforward - `npm install` resolved all UNMET DEPENDENCY issues and established proper workspace package linking. The development environment is now fully functional.
