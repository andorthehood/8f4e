/**
 * Converts a physical row index (which includes gap rows inserted for decorations) back into a logical row.
 * The `gaps` map stores how many extra rows were spliced after each logical line so plots, pianos, and error
 * callouts have dedicated vertical space; when translating from screen coordinates we need to subtract those
 * offsets to recover the original code line.
 * @param physicalRow Row index taken from rendered grid coordinates.
 * @param gaps Gap metadata keyed by logical row identifying how many physical rows were inserted after it.
 * @returns A non-negative logical row with gap offsets removed.
