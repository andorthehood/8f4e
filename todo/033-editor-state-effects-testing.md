# TODO: Comprehensive Testing for Editor State Effects System

The editor state effects system (`packages/editor/src/state/effects/`) is a critical component that handles binary assets, code blocks, compiler integration, menu system, and runtime management. Currently, only the runtime effects have test coverage (`runtime.test.ts`), leaving significant gaps in testing for:

- Binary assets management (`binaryAssets.ts`)
- Code blocks effects (`codeBlocks/` directory)
- Color theme effects (`colorTheme.ts`)
- Compiler integration (`compiler.ts`)
- Font management (`font.ts`)
- Asset loading (`loader.ts`)
- Menu system effects (`menu/` directory)
- Sample rate management (`sampleRate.ts`)
- Save/load functionality (`save.ts`)
- Viewport state logic management (`viewport.ts`) (not DOM interactions)

This lack of testing creates risks for future refactoring and makes it difficult to ensure these critical state management functions work correctly.

## Proposed Solution

Create comprehensive test coverage for all effects in the state system:
- Unit tests for each effect function
- Integration tests for effect combinations
- Mock implementations for external dependencies
- Test coverage for error handling and edge cases
- Snapshot testing for complex state transformations

## Implementation Plan

### Step 1: Binary Assets Testing
- Test `binaryAssets.ts` effects
- Mock file system interactions
- Test asset loading and management
- Expected outcome: Complete coverage of binary asset effects

### Step 2: Code Blocks Testing
- Test all files in `codeBlocks/` directory
- Test code block creation, modification, and deletion
- Test code block relationships and dependencies
- Expected outcome: Comprehensive code block effect testing

### Step 3: Core Effects Testing
- Test `colorTheme.ts`, `font.ts`, `sampleRate.ts` effects
- Test `compiler.ts` integration effects
- Test `loader.ts` asset loading effects
- Expected outcome: Core effects have complete test coverage

### Step 4: Menu System Testing
- Test all files in `menu/` directory
- Test menu state management and interactions
- Test menu effect chains and dependencies
- Expected outcome: Menu system effects fully tested

### Step 5: Save/Load and Viewport Testing
- Test `save.ts` persistence effects
- Test `viewport.ts` viewport management effects
- Test integration between save/load and viewport
- Expected outcome: Save/load and viewport effects tested

### Step 6: Integration Testing
- Test effect combinations and interactions
- Test error handling and recovery
- Test performance characteristics
- Expected outcome: Effects system works reliably together

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All effects files have dedicated test files
- [ ] Test coverage >90% for state effects directory
- [ ] All effects have unit tests with mocked dependencies
- [ ] Integration tests verify effect combinations work correctly
- [ ] Error handling and edge cases are tested
- [ ] All tests pass and run quickly (<2 seconds total)

## Affected Components

- `packages/editor/src/state/effects/binaryAssets.ts` - Create test file
- `packages/editor/src/state/effects/codeBlocks/` - Create tests for all files
- `packages/editor/src/state/effects/colorTheme.ts` - Create test file
- `packages/editor/src/state/effects/compiler.ts` - Create test file
- `packages/editor/src/state/effects/font.ts` - Create test file
- `packages/editor/src/state/effects/loader.ts` - Create test file
- `packages/editor/src/state/effects/menu/` - Create tests for all files
- `packages/editor/src/state/effects/sampleRate.ts` - Create test file
- `packages/editor/src/state/effects/save.ts` - Create test file
- `packages/editor/src/state/effects/viewport.ts` - Create test file

## Risks & Considerations

- **External Dependencies**: Many effects interact with external systems (file system, compiler) requiring careful mocking
- **State Complexity**: Effects modify complex state structures requiring thorough test setup
- **Integration Dependencies**: Some effects depend on others, requiring careful test ordering
- **Performance**: Large test suite could slow down development if not optimized

## Related Items

- **Blocks**: None currently
- **Depends on**: Jest configuration (already set up)
- **Related**: TODO-032 (main test coverage plan), existing runtime.test.ts patterns

## References

- [Existing Runtime Tests](packages/editor/src/state/effects/runtime.test.ts)
- [Effects Directory](packages/editor/src/state/effects/)
- [Jest Configuration](packages/editor/jest.config.js)

## Notes

- Start with simpler effects (colorTheme, font, sampleRate) before tackling complex ones (compiler, save/load)
- Use existing runtime.test.ts as a pattern for effect testing
- Focus on pure function testing where possible, mock external dependencies
- Consider using test factories for complex state setup
- Keep tests focused on state effects logic, not UI interactions

## Archive Instructions

When this TODO is completed, move it to the `todo/archived/` folder to keep the main todo directory clean and organized.
