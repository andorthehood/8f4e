# Migrate to Nx


## Status
- [x] Install Nx globally
- [x] Initialize Nx workspace
- [x] Migrate existing packages to Nx projects
- [x] Configure project dependencies and relationships
- [x] Test build and development workflows
- [x] Update CI/CD if applicable

## Completion Summary

**Completed**: 2024-12-11

Successfully migrated from npm workspaces to Nx workspace while keeping Parcel as the build tool. Key achievements:

1. ✅ **Nx Workspace Initialized**: Added Nx 21.4.1 with minimal configuration
2. ✅ **Package Detection**: Nx automatically detected all 8 packages as projects
3. ✅ **Dependency Management**: Configured `dependsOn: ["^build"]` for proper build order
4. ✅ **Caching Benefits**: Nx is providing significant caching improvements for builds, tests, and typecheck
5. ✅ **Script Migration**: Updated root package.json scripts to use `nx run-many` instead of `npm run --workspaces`
6. ✅ **Build Verification**: All packages build successfully with proper dependency resolution
7. ✅ **Test Verification**: All tests pass (171 tests across compiler and editor packages)
8. ✅ **TypeScript Support**: TypeCheck works across all packages
9. ✅ **Parcel Integration**: Main application still builds with Parcel successfully

The monorepo now benefits from Nx's intelligent caching and dependency management while maintaining compatibility with existing Parcel builds. This provides a solid foundation for the future Vite migration.

## Description
Migrate from npm workspaces to Nx workspace while keeping Parcel as the build tool initially. This provides a foundation for the later Vite migration.

## Prerequisites
- Complete todo `013-fix-npm-ls-errors.md`
- All packages marked as private
- Clean dependency graph
- Consistent package.json structures

## Tasks

### 1. **Setup Nx Workspace**
- Install Nx CLI globally: `npm install -g nx`
- Initialize Nx workspace at root level
- Configure workspace settings in `nx.json`
- Set up project graph and dependency management

### 2. **Migrate Existing Packages**
- Convert each package in `packages/` to Nx projects
- Update package.json files to work with Nx
- Configure build targets for each project
- Set up proper project naming and organization

### 3. **Configure Build System**
- Keep Parcel as the build tool initially
- Configure Nx to use Parcel for builds
- Set up build targets and scripts
- Ensure all packages can build independently

### 4. **Project Dependencies**
- Configure project dependencies in Nx
- Set up proper import/export relationships
- Ensure no circular dependencies
- Configure project graph correctly

### 5. **Development Workflow**
- Test `nx run-many` for building multiple projects
- Test `nx affected` for incremental builds
- Verify development server functionality
- Test package linking and imports

### 6. **Cleanup and Optimization**
- Remove npm workspace configuration
- Update root package.json scripts
- Optimize Nx configuration
- Document new workflow

## Benefits
- Better project organization and dependency management
- Improved build performance with caching
- Better project graph visualization
- Foundation for Vite migration
- Enhanced development experience

## Notes
- Keep Parcel during this migration - don't change build tools yet
- Focus on getting Nx workspace stable before Vite migration
- Test thoroughly to ensure no functionality is lost
- Document any Nx-specific configurations or workflows
