# TODO: Plan and Implement Comprehensive Test Coverage for Editor Package

**Priority**: ðŸŸ¡
**Estimated Effort**: 3-5 days
**Created**: 2025-02-03
**Status**: Open
**Completed**: 

## Problem Description

The editor package currently has minimal test coverage, with only a few test files in the `config` and `midi` directories. This lack of testing creates several problems:
- No confidence that refactoring won't break existing functionality
- Difficult to verify bug fixes work correctly
- Hard to ensure new features don't introduce regressions
- Code quality and maintainability suffer without test coverage

## Proposed Solution

Create a comprehensive testing strategy that divides the editor package into distinct, non-overlapping areas that can be worked on in parallel by different AI agents. Each area will have its own dedicated todo item with specific testing goals and implementation plans.

## Implementation Plan

### Step 1: Create Individual Test Coverage TODOs âœ…
- Create separate todo items for each major area identified
- Ensure areas are truly non-overlapping to enable parallel work
- Each todo should have clear scope, success criteria, and implementation steps
- **Each todo must follow the `_template.md` format for consistency**
- **Expected outcome**: 6-7 focused todo items ready for parallel execution
- **Deliverable**: A set of individual todo files that can be assigned to different AI agents
- **Completed**: Created 7 focused TODO items covering all identified areas

### Step 2: Set Up Testing Infrastructure
- Verify Jest configuration is properly set up for all areas
- Ensure test utilities and mocks are available where needed
- Set up test coverage reporting
- Expected outcome: Robust testing foundation for all areas

### Step 3: Execute Test Implementation in Parallel
- Assign different AI agents to work on separate todo items simultaneously
- Monitor progress and resolve any conflicts or dependencies
- **Expected outcome**: The individual todo items are ready for execution by AI agents
- **Note**: This step focuses on preparing the todo items, not implementing the actual tests

## Success Criteria

- [x] 6-7 focused todo items created with clear, non-overlapping scopes
- [x] Each todo item has specific, measurable testing goals
- [ ] Testing infrastructure is verified and ready for all areas
- [x] All todo items can be worked on independently and in parallel
- [x] **Primary Goal**: A collection of focused, parallel-ready todo items that cover all editor package areas

## Affected Components

- `packages/editor/src/state/` - State management and effects testing
- `packages/editor/src/events/` - Event handling and coordination testing
- `packages/editor/src/midi/` - MIDI functionality testing (partially covered)
- `packages/editor/src/config/` - Configuration and feature flags testing (partially covered)
- `packages/editor/src/integration/` - Integration testing (partially covered)
- `packages/editor/src/types/` - Type definitions and validation testing
- **Note**: View layer and DOM-dependent UI interactions will be outsourced

## Detailed Area Breakdown

### 1. State Management (`packages/editor/src/state/`)
- **Core State Logic**: `types.ts`, `index.ts`
- **Effects System**: `effects/` directory - binary assets, code blocks, compiler integration, menu system
- **Helpers**: `helpers/` directory - base64 decoder, code parsers, editor utilities
- **Mutators**: `mutators/` directory - viewport management



### 2. Event System (`packages/editor/src/events/`)
- **Event Coordination**: `index.ts` - event routing and management (pure logic)
- **Note**: DOM-dependent user interaction handling will be outsourced

### 3. MIDI Functionality (`packages/editor/src/midi/`)
- **CC Names**: `ccNames.ts` - MIDI CC name mappings (partially tested)
- **Enums**: `enums.ts` - MIDI constants and enumerations
- **Integration**: MIDI event handling and processing

### 4. Configuration (`packages/editor/src/config/`)
- **Feature Flags**: `featureFlags.ts` - feature toggle system (partially tested)
- **Configuration Management**: General config utilities and settings

### 5. Integration Testing (`packages/editor/src/integration/`)
- **Cross-Component Testing**: Integration between different editor subsystems
- **Core Logic Flows**: Pure logic workflows and data transformations
- **Note**: DOM-dependent end-to-end flows will be outsourced

### 6. Type System (`packages/editor/src/types/`)
- **Type Definitions**: Core type interfaces and structures
- **Validation**: Type checking and runtime validation utilities
- **Vite Environment**: Build-time type definitions

### 7. Cross-Cutting Concerns
- **Test Utilities**: Common testing patterns and utilities
- **Mock Data**: Test fixtures and mock implementations
- **Test Configuration**: Jest setup and test environment configuration

## Risks & Considerations

- **Risk 1**: Areas may have hidden dependencies that prevent true parallelization
  - **Mitigation**: Careful analysis of imports and shared utilities before creating todos
- **Risk 2**: Different testing approaches may create inconsistencies
  - **Mitigation**: Establish common testing patterns and utilities upfront
- **Dependencies**: Jest configuration and test utilities must be verified first
- **Breaking Changes**: Testing implementation should not affect existing functionality

## Related Items

- **Blocks**: Future refactoring and feature development
- **Depends on**: Existing Jest configuration and testing setup
- **Related**: Compiler package testing patterns, sprite-generator testing patterns

## References

- [Jest Configuration](packages/editor/jest.config.js)
- [Editor Package Structure](packages/editor/src/)
- [Existing Test Examples](packages/editor/src/config/featureFlags.test.ts)

## Notes

- Current test coverage is minimal, with only `config/featureFlags.test.ts` and `midi/ccNames.test.ts` existing
- Jest is already configured and ready for testing
- The package has complex state management and core logic that will benefit significantly from testing
- **This todo's purpose is to create the roadmap and individual todo items, not to implement the actual tests**
- **The deliverable is a collection of focused todo items that can be worked on in parallel by different AI agents**
- **Each individual todo item will contain the actual test implementation plan for its specific area**
- **All individual todos must follow the `_template.md` format to ensure consistency and completeness**
- **Focus**: Testing will focus on pure logic and core functionality, excluding DOM-dependent UI interactions that will be outsourced
