# TODO: Research C/C++ WebAssembly Runtimes on Linux with ALSA Audio Support

**Priority**: ðŸŸ¡  
**Estimated Effort**: 4-6 days  
**Created**: 2024-12-19  
**Status**: Open  
**Completed**: 

## Problem Description

The 8f4e project requires a native C/C++ runtime for Linux systems with ALSA audio integration to complement the existing browser-based WebAssembly runtimes. Currently, the project only supports browser environments (WebWorker and AudioWorklet runtimes), limiting deployment to web applications.

Current state:
- 8f4e compiles to WebAssembly bytecode optimized for real-time audio processing
- Browser runtimes exist but are constrained by web security and API limitations
- Future plans include LinuxALSA runtime for headless audio processing applications
- The language has specific constraints: no runtime memory allocation, stack-based execution, optimized for low-latency audio

Impact:
- Cannot deploy 8f4e applications as standalone Linux audio applications
- Missing opportunity for server-side audio processing, DAW plugins, or embedded Linux audio systems
- Lack of integration with professional audio infrastructure using ALSA
- Performance potentially limited by browser overhead and security restrictions

## Proposed Solution

Conduct comprehensive research and evaluation of C/C++ embeddable WebAssembly runtimes specifically for Linux environments with ALSA audio integration. Create a structured comparison matrix evaluating technical specifications, integration complexity, and suitability for 8f4e's real-time audio processing requirements.

High-level approach:
- Survey available C/C++ WebAssembly runtimes with embedding APIs
- Analyze ALSA integration strategies and host function approaches
- Evaluate real-time audio performance characteristics and latency considerations
- Assess execution modes (interpreter, AOT, JIT) and their audio processing trade-offs
- Consider runtime size, dependencies, and maintainability for production deployment
- Provide detailed recommendations based on 8f4e's specific audio processing needs

Key runtimes to evaluate:
1. **Wasmtime (C/C++ API)** - Cranelift-based runtime with comprehensive C/C++ bindings
2. **WAMR (WebAssembly Micro Runtime)** - Intel's lightweight runtime with interpreter/AOT/JIT modes
3. **Wasm3** - Ultra-lightweight interpreter optimized for embedded systems
4. **Wasmer** - Full-featured runtime with C API and multiple execution engines
5. **WasmEdge** - Cloud-native runtime with C++ API and extension support
6. **WebAssembly C API** - VM-agnostic standard approach for runtime integration

Alternative approaches considered:
- Direct native code generation (loses WebAssembly portability and toolchain benefits)
- Hybrid approach combining multiple runtimes for different use cases
- Custom WebAssembly interpreter implementation (high maintenance overhead)

## Implementation Plan

### Step 1: Runtime Discovery and C/C++ API Analysis
- Document C/C++ embedding APIs for each candidate runtime
- Analyze API complexity, documentation quality, and ease of integration
- Evaluate build system requirements and dependency management

### Step 3: Real-time Audio Performance Evaluation
- Benchmark execution latency for audio processing workloads

- Measure CPU usage and thermal characteristics during sustained operation
- **Expected outcome**: Performance benchmark results and recommendations
- **Dependencies**: Step 2

### Step 4: Execution Mode Analysis
- Compare interpreter vs AOT vs JIT execution modes for audio workloads
- Analyze startup time vs runtime performance trade-offs
- Evaluate memory usage patterns for different execution modes
- Test compilation time impact on development workflow
- Document predictable timing behavior for real-time audio requirements
- **Expected outcome**: Execution mode recommendation matrix
- **Dependencies**: Step 3

### Step 5: Runtime Size and Dependencies Assessment
- Analyze binary size impact for distribution and deployment
- Document runtime dependencies and system requirements
- Evaluate static vs dynamic linking considerations
- Assess impact on application startup time and memory footprint
- Consider containerization and packaging implications
- **Expected outcome**: Deployment architecture recommendations
- **Dependencies**: Step 4

### Step 6: Security and Isolation Evaluation
- Research sandboxing capabilities and security model of each runtime
- Evaluate host function security and capability-based access control
- Analyze potential attack vectors in audio processing contexts
- Document security trade-offs with performance requirements
- Consider implications for plugin architectures and untrusted code execution
- **Expected outcome**: Security assessment and recommendations
- **Dependencies**: Step 5

### Step 7: 8f4e-Specific Integration Assessment
- Analyze compatibility with 8f4e's WebAssembly module structure
- Evaluate integration with existing compiler output format
- Test sample 8f4e audio modules with candidate runtimes
- Document required changes to build pipeline and toolchain
- Assess impact on development workflow and debugging capabilities
- **Expected outcome**: Integration complexity assessment and implementation roadmap
- **Dependencies**: Step 6

### Step 8: Recommendations and Decision Matrix
- Create comprehensive comparison matrix with weighted scoring
- Provide specific recommendations for different use cases (development, production, embedded)
- Document implementation priorities and phased rollout strategy
- Create proof-of-concept implementation plan for top candidate
- Establish success criteria for runtime integration validation
- **Expected outcome**: Final research report with actionable recommendations
- **Dependencies**: Step 7

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Specific recommendations for 8f4e LinuxALSA runtime implementation
- [ ] Implementation roadmap with effort estimates and risk assessment
- [ ] Working proof-of-concept demonstrating audio I/O with top candidate runtime

## Affected Components

- `packages/runtime-*` - New LinuxALSA runtime package will be created
- `packages/compiler` - May need modifications for C/C++ runtime integration
- `packages/editor` - Runtime selection UI will need LinuxALSA option
- `src/examples` - Example applications demonstrating native Linux capabilities
- `docs/` - Documentation for native runtime setup and deployment

## Risks & Considerations

- **Risk 1**: Runtime performance may not meet real-time audio requirements
  - Mitigation: Include comprehensive benchmarking in research, consider multiple execution modes
- **Risk 2**: ALSA integration complexity may be higher than anticipated
  - Mitigation: Research multiple integration approaches, consider abstraction layers
- **Risk 3**: C/C++ API complexity may impact development velocity
  - Mitigation: Prioritize runtimes with well-documented APIs and good community support
- **Risk 4**: Runtime dependencies may conflict with target deployment environments
  - Mitigation: Evaluate multiple runtimes with different dependency profiles
- **Dependencies**: Research depends on runtime documentation availability and test environment setup
- **Breaking Changes**: None expected for research phase, but findings may influence architecture decisions
