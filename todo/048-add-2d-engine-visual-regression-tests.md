# TODO: Add 2D Engine Visual Regression Tests

**Priority**: ��
**Estimated Effort**: 6-8 hours
**Created**: 2025-08-28
**Status**: Open

The 2D engine package currently lacks visual regression testing, which means:
- Rendering bugs may go undetected during refactoring
- Changes to shaders, coordinate systems, or rendering logic could break visual output
- No automated way to verify that sprite rendering, transformations, and effects work correctly
- Manual visual verification is time-consuming and error-prone
- Performance regressions in rendering pipeline may not be caught

Visual regression tests would provide confidence that the engine continues to render correctly as code evolves.

## Proposed Solution

Implement visual regression testing for the 2D engine using:
- **Jest + Puppeteer** or **Playwright** for headless browser testing
- **Pixel-perfect screenshot comparison** for rendering validation
- **Test fixtures** with known sprite sheets and rendering scenarios
- **Automated baseline generation** and comparison
- **CI/CD integration** for catching visual regressions early

## Implementation Plan

### Step 1: Set up visual testing infrastructure
- Install and configure Puppeteer/Playwright for headless browser testing
- Create test HTML pages for different rendering scenarios
- Set up screenshot capture and comparison utilities
- Configure Jest to handle visual test assets

### Step 2: Create basic rendering test fixtures
- Simple sprite rendering tests (single sprites, multiple sprites)
- Transform system tests (offsets, groups, scaling)
- Basic shape rendering tests (rectangles, lines)
- Test with known sprite sheets and expected outputs

### Step 3: Implement advanced rendering scenarios
- Complex transformation chains (nested groups, rotations)
- Performance tests (large numbers of sprites)
- Animation tests (time-based shader effects)
- Edge case tests (boundary conditions, extreme values)

### Step 4: Set up CI/CD integration
- Configure visual tests to run in CI pipeline
- Set up baseline image management
- Implement failure reporting with visual diffs
- Configure test result storage and comparison

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Visual regression tests run successfully in CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Tests cover all major rendering scenarios (sprites, transforms, effects)
- [ ] Baseline images are automatically generated and maintained
- [ ] Visual diffs are generated for failed tests
- [ ] Tests can detect pixel-level rendering changes
- [ ] Performance benchmarks are included for rendering operations

## Affected Components

- `packages/2d-engine/tests/` - Visual test directory and fixtures
- `packages/2d-engine/package.json` - New testing dependencies
- `packages/2d-engine/jest.config.js` - Visual testing configuration
- `packages/2d-engine/test-fixtures/` - Test HTML pages and assets
- CI/CD pipeline configuration

## Risks & Considerations

- **Risk 1**: Platform-specific rendering differences (OS, GPU drivers)
  - **Mitigation**: Use consistent CI environment and tolerance for minor variations
- **Risk 2**: Test maintenance overhead for visual assets
  - **Mitigation**: Automate baseline generation and use semantic test descriptions
- **Risk 3**: Performance impact of visual testing
  - **Mitigation**: Run visual tests separately from unit tests, use parallel execution
- **Dependencies**: Jest configuration, headless browser setup
- **Breaking Changes**: None - tests are additive only

## Notes

- Visual tests should focus on rendering correctness, not exact pixel matching
- Consider using tolerance values for anti-aliasing and minor rendering variations
- Test fixtures should include both simple and complex rendering scenarios
- Performance benchmarks can be integrated with visual tests
- Baseline images should be version-controlled and reviewed with code changes
