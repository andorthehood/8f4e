# Architecture Decision Records

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for the 8f4e project.

## What is an ADR?

An Architecture Decision Record (ADR) is a document that captures an important architectural decision made along with its context and consequences.

## Format

Each ADR follows this structure:
- **Title**: Short descriptive title
- **Status**: Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated, or Superseded
- **Context**: The issue motivating this decision
- **Decision**: The change we're proposing or have made
- **Consequences**: The resulting context after applying the decision (both positive and negative)
