# TODO: Lazy Load Runtimes

## Problem Description

Currently, all runtime modules are imported synchronously at the top of `packages/editor/src/state/effects/runtime.ts`, which means they are loaded even when not needed. This increases the initial bundle size and startup time.

**Current State**: All three runtime modules (AudioWorkletRuntime, WebWorkerMIDIRuntime, WebWorkerLogicRuntime) are statically imported and loaded upfront.

**Why this is a problem**: 
- Unused runtimes are included in the main bundle, increasing bundle size
- All runtime code is parsed and loaded during startup, delaying initial page load
- Even inactive runtimes consume memory unnecessarily

**Impact**: Slower initial page load, larger bundle size, and suboptimal memory usage.

## Proposed Solution

**High-level approach**: Implement dynamic imports and lazy loading for runtime modules using ES6 dynamic imports and a runtime registry pattern.

**Key changes required**:
- Replace static imports with dynamic import functions
- Create a runtime registry with metadata and loader functions
- Implement runtime factory pattern for consistent initialization
- Add loading states and error handling for runtime switching

**Alternative approaches considered**:
- Code splitting with webpack chunks (rejected - Vite handles this better)
- Runtime bundling (rejected - would increase complexity)

## Implementation Plan

### Step 1: Create Runtime Registry
- Create `packages/editor/src/state/effects/runtimes/registry.ts`
- Define runtime metadata and loader functions
- Add type definitions for runtime factories
- **Expected outcome**: Centralized runtime management system
- **Dependencies**: None

### Step 2: Refactor Main Runtime Module
- Remove static imports from `runtime.ts`
- Replace runtime initialization with async factory calls
- Add loading state management
- Implement runtime switching with proper cleanup
- **Expected outcome**: Lazy-loaded runtime initialization
- **Dependencies**: Step 1 completion

### Step 3: Update Runtime Modules
- Ensure each runtime exports a factory function
- Add proper error handling and validation
- Implement consistent initialization patterns
- **Expected outcome**: Standardized runtime interface
- **Dependencies**: Step 2 completion

### Step 4: Testing and Validation
- Test runtime switching scenarios
- Verify memory cleanup on runtime changes
- Performance testing for bundle size reduction
- Cross-browser compatibility testing
- **Expected outcome**: Verified lazy loading functionality
- **Dependencies**: All previous steps

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Bundle size reduced by 20-30% for initial load
- [ ] Runtime modules load only when selected
- [ ] Runtime switching works smoothly (UI improvements will be handled separately)
- [ ] Memory usage reduced for inactive runtimes
- [ ] All existing functionality preserved
- [ ] Performance improvements measurable in bundle analyzer

## Affected Components

- `packages/editor/src/state/effects/runtime.ts` - Main runtime management logic
- `packages/editor/src/state/effects/runtimes/audioWorkletRuntime.ts` - Audio worklet runtime
- `packages/editor/src/state/effects/runtimes/webWorkerMIDIRuntime.ts` - MIDI worker runtime
- `packages/editor/src/state/effects/runtimes/webWorkerLogicRuntime.ts` - Logic worker runtime
- `packages/editor/src/state/effects/runtimes/registry.ts` - New runtime registry (to be created)

## Risks & Considerations

- **Bundle splitting complexity**: Vite configuration may need updates for optimal code splitting
- **Runtime load failures**: Network issues or parsing errors could break runtime switching
- **Memory leaks**: Improper cleanup could lead to memory leaks during runtime switching
- **Dependencies**: No external dependencies, but requires careful testing of dynamic imports
- **Breaking Changes**: None expected - maintains backward compatibility

## Related Items

- **Blocks**: None currently
- **Depends on**: None
- **Related**: Performance optimization initiatives, bundle size reduction goals

## Notes

- This refactoring maintains backward compatibility
- Runtime switching behavior remains the same from user perspective
- Performance improvements should be measurable in bundle analyzer
- Consider implementing as feature flag for gradual rollout
- Uses native ES6 dynamic imports - no additional dependencies required
- Compatible with current Vite configuration and TypeScript setup
- **UI improvements**: Loading states and progress indicators will be implemented in a separate TODO item
