# TODO: Create Editor Test Utilities and Cross-Cutting Testing Infrastructure

**Priority**: ðŸŸ¡
**Estimated Effort**: 1-2 days
**Created**: 2025-02-17
**Status**: Open
**Completed**: 

## Problem Description

As editor testing coverage expands across multiple areas (state effects, events, MIDI, configuration, integration, types), there is a need for:

- Common testing patterns and utilities
- Shared mock implementations
- Test fixtures and test data factories
- Consistent testing configuration and setup
- Cross-cutting testing concerns that don't fit into specific component areas

Without these utilities, each testing area will need to recreate common testing infrastructure, leading to:
- Duplicated test setup code
- Inconsistent testing patterns
- Difficult test maintenance
- Slower test development

## Proposed Solution

Create a comprehensive test utilities framework that supports all editor testing areas:
- Common test utilities and helper functions
- Shared mock implementations for external dependencies
- Test data factories for complex editor state
- Consistent testing patterns and conventions
- Test configuration and setup utilities

## Implementation Plan

### Step 1: Common Test Utilities
- Create shared test helper functions
- Create state assertion utilities
- Create test setup and teardown helpers
- Expected outcome: Common testing patterns are available to all areas

### Step 2: Mock Implementations
- Create mock implementations for external dependencies
- Create mock state and effect implementations
- Create mock event and MIDI implementations
- Expected outcome: Consistent mocks available across all testing areas

### Step 3: Test Data Factories
- Create factories for complex editor state objects
- Create test fixtures for common scenarios
- Create data generators for edge case testing
- Expected outcome: Easy creation of test data for all testing scenarios

### Step 4: Testing Configuration
- Enhance Jest configuration for editor-specific needs
- Create test environment setup utilities
- Create test performance and coverage utilities
- Expected outcome: Optimized testing environment for editor package

### Step 5: Documentation and Patterns
- Document testing patterns and conventions
- Create testing guidelines for editor package
- Create examples of testing best practices
- Expected outcome: Clear guidance for all editor testing efforts

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Common test utilities are available for all testing areas
- [ ] Shared mock implementations eliminate duplication
- [ ] Test data factories make test creation easy
- [ ] Testing configuration is optimized for editor package
- [ ] Testing patterns are documented and consistent
- [ ] All utility functions have their own tests
- [ ] Test utilities improve testing speed and maintainability

## Affected Components

- Create `packages/editor/src/__tests__/utils/` directory for test utilities
- Create `packages/editor/src/__tests__/mocks/` directory for shared mocks
- Create `packages/editor/src/__tests__/fixtures/` directory for test data
- Enhance `packages/editor/jest.config.js` with optimizations
- Create testing documentation in editor package

## Risks & Considerations

- **Over-Engineering**: Test utilities could become overly complex
- **Maintenance Overhead**: Utilities need their own maintenance and testing
- **Adoption**: Other testing areas need to consistently use utilities
- **Evolution**: Utilities need to evolve as testing requirements grow
- **Dependencies**: Utilities should minimize external dependencies

## Related Items

- **Blocks**: None currently, but supports all other testing TODOs
- **Depends on**: Jest configuration (already set up)
- **Related**: All other editor testing TODOs (033-038) will benefit from these utilities

## Notes

- This TODO can be worked on in parallel with other testing areas
- Start with utilities needed by the simplest testing areas (MIDI, config)
- Gradually expand utilities as more complex testing needs arise
- Focus on utilities that eliminate the most duplication
- Keep utilities simple and focused on editor-specific needs
- Consider creating utilities that can be used by other packages
- Test utilities should themselves be well-tested
- Good area for someone with strong testing experience
