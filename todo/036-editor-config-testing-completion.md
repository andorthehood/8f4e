# TODO: Complete Configuration System Testing Coverage

**Priority**: 🟢
**Estimated Effort**: 1 day
**Created**: 2025-08-27
**Status**: Open
**Completed**: 

## Problem Description

The configuration system (`packages/editor/src/config/`) has partial test coverage with only `featureFlags.test.ts` implemented. The configuration system includes:

- Feature flags (`featureFlags.ts`) - ✓ Already tested
- General configuration management - ❌ Not tested
- Configuration utilities and settings - ❌ Not tested

Complete configuration testing is needed to ensure configuration management works correctly and feature flags behave as expected across all scenarios.

## Proposed Solution

Complete the configuration testing coverage by:
- Expanding `featureFlags.test.ts` with more comprehensive scenarios
- Adding tests for any additional configuration utilities
- Testing configuration persistence and loading
- Testing feature flag edge cases and combinations
- Adding integration tests for configuration system

## Implementation Plan

### Step 1: Expand Feature Flags Testing
- Review existing `featureFlags.test.ts` for completeness
- Add edge case testing for feature flag combinations
- Test feature flag persistence and state management
- Test feature flag validation and error handling
- Expected outcome: Comprehensive feature flags testing

### Step 2: Configuration Utilities Testing
- Identify any additional configuration utilities in the directory
- Create tests for configuration loading and validation
- Test configuration defaults and overrides
- Expected outcome: All configuration utilities are tested

### Step 3: Configuration Integration Testing
- Test configuration integration with state management
- Test configuration changes and their effects
- Test configuration persistence across sessions
- Expected outcome: Configuration system integration works reliably

### Step 4: Edge Cases and Error Handling
- Test invalid configuration scenarios
- Test configuration system error recovery
- Test configuration migration and compatibility
- Expected outcome: Robust configuration error handling

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Feature flags testing is comprehensive and covers all scenarios
- [ ] All configuration utilities have test coverage
- [ ] Configuration integration scenarios are tested
- [ ] Configuration error handling is thoroughly tested
- [ ] Test coverage >95% for config directory
- [ ] All tests pass and run quickly (<500ms total)

## Affected Components

- `packages/editor/src/config/featureFlags.test.ts` - Expand and enhance
- Any additional configuration files in the config directory
- Configuration integration points with state system
- Configuration persistence mechanisms

## Risks & Considerations

- **Feature Flag Complexity**: Feature flag combinations can create complex testing scenarios
- **Configuration Persistence**: Testing persistence requires mocking storage mechanisms
- **Integration Dependencies**: Configuration affects many other systems, requiring careful integration testing
- **Low Priority**: Configuration is working and partially tested, so this is lower priority

## Related Items

- **Blocks**: None currently
- **Depends on**: Jest configuration (already set up)
- **Related**: TODO-032 (main test coverage plan), existing featureFlags.test.ts

## References

- [Config Directory](packages/editor/src/config/)

- [Integration Tests](packages/editor/src/integration/featureFlags.test.ts)
- [Jest Configuration](packages/editor/jest.config.js)

## Notes

- Configuration testing is one of the smaller and more contained testing areas
- Existing featureFlags.test.ts provides a good foundation to build on
- Consider testing feature flag combinations and interactions
- Mock localStorage/sessionStorage for configuration persistence testing
- Focus on configuration logic rather than storage implementation details
- Integration with feature flags test shows some configuration testing patterns
- This is a good area for someone familiar with configuration systems
