 * Searches all code blocks (topmost first) for the one that contains the viewport-relative coordinates.

 * @param state State providing the current viewport origin and code block rendering state.
 * @param searchX Viewport-relative x coordinate to test.
 * @param searchY Viewport-relative y coordinate to test.
 * @returns The foremost block containing the point, or `undefined` when none overlap it.
