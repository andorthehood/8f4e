# TODO: Benchmark Unrolled vs Normal Loop in Audio Buffer Filler

**Priority**: ðŸŸ¡  
**Estimated Effort**: 8-12 hours  
**Created**: 2024-09-07  
**Status**: Open  
**Completed**: 

## Problem Description

The audio buffer filler loop is currently implemented using an unrolled approach in `packages/compiler/src/index.ts` (line 275):

```typescript
createFunction([], new Array(128).fill(call(1)).flat())
```

This generates WebAssembly that calls the `cycle()` function 128 times directly, rather than using a standard loop with dynamic bounds. While loop unrolling can reduce overhead by eliminating branch instructions and loop counters, it also increases code size which may negatively impact instruction cache performance.

**Current Impact:**
- Unknown whether unrolled approach provides measurable performance benefits in WebAssembly context
- No empirical data comparing unrolled vs standard loop implementations
- Potential sub-optimal performance if unrolling is counterproductive
- Larger WASM bytecode size without understanding the performance trade-offs

## Proposed Solution

Conduct comprehensive performance research comparing unrolled loop implementation against standard fixed-bound loop implementations in WebAssembly, specifically for audio buffer filling use cases.

The research should provide empirical data to inform decisions about optimal loop implementation strategies for different scenarios (buffer sizes, browsers, hardware configurations).

## Implementation Plan

### Step 1: Create Benchmark Infrastructure
- Develop WebAssembly test modules with both unrolled and standard loop implementations
- Create timing harness that can measure performance across different scenarios
- Set up test framework that can run consistently across different browsers and environments
- **Dependencies**: Understanding of WebAssembly performance measurement techniques

### Step 2: Implement Loop Variants
- **Unrolled variant**: Current implementation approach with direct function calls
- **Standard loop variant**: Traditional for-loop with dynamic bound checking
- **Hybrid variants**: Partially unrolled loops (e.g., unroll by 4, 8, 16)
- **Dependencies**: WebAssembly loop generation capabilities

### Step 3: Design Benchmark Suite
- Test different buffer sizes: 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024 samples
- Measure across different audio processing scenarios (simple, complex computation)
- Include both cold-start and warm-up performance measurements
- Test with realistic audio workload patterns
- **Dependencies**: Representative audio processing test cases

### Step 4: Cross-Compiler Analysis
- Generate WASM with different compilation targets (clang, rustc)
- Analyze generated bytecode for optimization differences
- Document how different compilers handle loop unrolling when targeting WASM
- **Dependencies**: Access to multiple WebAssembly compilation toolchains

### Step 5: Cross-Browser Testing
- Chrome (V8 JavaScript engine)
- Firefox (SpiderMonkey JavaScript engine)  
- Safari (JavaScriptCore engine) if available
- Standalone WebAssembly runtimes (wasmtime, wasmer)
- **Dependencies**: Access to different browser environments

### Step 6: Performance Analysis
- Instruction cache impact analysis
- Memory usage comparison between variants
- CPU utilization patterns
- Identify performance characteristics and optimal use cases for each approach
- **Dependencies**: Performance profiling tools and methodologies

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Comprehensive benchmark results comparing unrolled vs standard loop performance
- [ ] Documentation of performance characteristics across different buffer sizes
- [ ] Analysis of compiler optimization behavior for WebAssembly loops
- [ ] Browser/runtime performance comparison data
- [ ] Recommendations for optimal loop implementation strategy
- [ ] Test infrastructure that can be used for future performance validation

## Affected Components

- `packages/compiler/src/index.ts` - Contains current unrolled loop implementation (line 275)
- `packages/runtime-audio-worklet/src/` - Audio processing runtime that executes the buffer function
- `packages/compiler/src/types.ts` - May need CompileOptions extensions for loop strategy selection
- Future benchmark test suite - New component for performance testing

## Risks & Considerations

- **Measurement accuracy**: WebAssembly performance can be affected by browser JIT optimizations, requiring careful benchmark design
- **Environment variability**: Performance characteristics may vary significantly across different hardware configurations
- **Real-world applicability**: Synthetic benchmarks may not reflect real-world audio processing performance
- **Implementation complexity**: Creating fair comparison requires equivalent functionality across loop strategies
- **Browser differences**: Different JavaScript engines may have varying WebAssembly optimization strategies

## Notes

- Current implementation assumes 128 samples is optimal without empirical validation
- The existing `060-audio-buffer-cycle-length-configuration.md` analysis focuses on configurability but doesn't address fundamental performance trade-offs between loop strategies
- WebAssembly's lack of direct instruction cache control makes this analysis particularly important
- Results should inform potential future configurability of loop unrolling strategy
- Consider impact on compilation time as well as runtime performance
