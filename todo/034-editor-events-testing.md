# TODO: Comprehensive Testing for Editor Event System

**Priority**: ðŸŸ¡
**Estimated Effort**: 1-2 days
**Created**: 2025-01-12
**Status**: Open
**Completed**: 

## Problem Description

The editor event system (`packages/editor/src/events/`) coordinates event routing and management between different parts of the editor. Currently, this critical coordination layer has no test coverage, creating risks for:

- Event routing logic in `index.ts`
- Human interface abstraction in `humanInterface.ts`
- Event coordination between editor components
- Event flow management and error handling

Without testing, changes to the event system could break editor functionality in subtle ways that are difficult to debug.

## Proposed Solution

Create focused test coverage for the event system's pure logic components:
- Unit tests for event routing and coordination logic
- Tests for human interface abstraction layer
- Mock implementations for event dependencies
- Integration tests for event flow between components
- Error handling and edge case testing

Note: This focuses on pure logic testing. DOM-dependent user interaction handling will be addressed separately when the view layer is extracted.

## Implementation Plan

### Step 1: Event Coordination Testing
- Test `index.ts` event routing and management logic
- Mock external dependencies and event sources
- Test event flow coordination between components
- Expected outcome: Core event coordination logic is tested

### Step 2: Human Interface Testing
- Test `humanInterface.ts` abstraction layer
- Test interface methods and event translation
- Mock human interface dependencies
- Expected outcome: Human interface layer has complete coverage

### Step 3: Integration Testing
- Test event system integration with state management
- Test event handling error cases and recovery
- Test event system performance characteristics
- Expected outcome: Event system works reliably with other components

### Step 4: Edge Case and Error Testing
- Test invalid event scenarios
- Test error propagation and handling
- Test event system under stress conditions
- Expected outcome: Robust error handling and edge case coverage

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All event system files have dedicated test files
- [ ] Test coverage >90% for events directory
- [ ] Event routing logic is thoroughly tested
- [ ] Human interface abstraction is fully tested
- [ ] Integration with state system is tested
- [ ] Error handling and edge cases are covered
- [ ] All tests pass and run quickly (<1 second total)

## Affected Components

- `packages/editor/src/events/index.ts` - Create comprehensive test file
- `packages/editor/src/events/humanInterface.ts` - Create comprehensive test file
- Test integration points with state management system
- Mock implementations for external event dependencies

## Risks & Considerations

- **State Dependencies**: Event system interacts closely with state management, requiring careful mocking
- **Human Interface Abstraction**: Testing interface layer without actual hardware input requires good mocks
- **Integration Complexity**: Event flow between components can be complex to test in isolation
- **Future Changes**: When view layer is extracted, some event tests may need updating

## Related Items

- **Blocks**: None currently
- **Depends on**: Jest configuration (already set up)
- **Related**: TODO-032 (main test coverage plan), TODO-025 (view layer separation), TODO-026 (user interactions separation)

- [Events Directory](packages/editor/src/events/)
- [State Integration](packages/editor/src/state/)
- [Jest Configuration](packages/editor/jest.config.js)

## Notes

- Focus on pure logic testing, avoid DOM-dependent interactions
- Use existing state helper tests as patterns for event testing
- Consider creating event test utilities for common scenarios
- Mock human interface dependencies to test abstract interface
- Keep tests fast and focused on event coordination logic
- Event system will likely need updates when view/input layers are separated
