# Web UI Render Projection

`@8f4e/web-ui-render-projection` derives web-ui-specific render data from editor state before the renderer needs it. It
moves repeatable preparation work out of the frame hot path while keeping editor-state independent from rendering
concerns.

The projection is a disposable read model, not a second source of truth. Its data can always be rebuilt from the
current editor state and rendering resources.

```text
editor-state ──changes──▶ web-ui-render-projection ──snapshot──▶ web-ui
                                   ▲
                                   │
                         sprite and lifecycle events
```

The default editor package is the composition root. It creates editor-state and the web UI render projection as sibling
layers, then passes both to the renderer. Editor-state does not import or initialize the render projection.

## Why This Package Exists

The renderer should spend each frame submitting already-prepared drawing data. Work that changes only when editor
state or rendering resources change can happen earlier, including:

- syntax highlighting;
- tab expansion into visual cells;
- line-number preparation and conversion of collapsed placeholders into render cells;
- character and font lookup resolution into sprite IDs;
- disabled-code font selection; and
- insertion of blank rows for editor-owned logical gaps.

The first extracted projection produces code-cell matrices. More render-only derivations can move here incrementally
when their ownership boundary is clear.

## Ownership Boundary

### Editor-state owns

- source code and editor directives;
- cursor, selection, dragging, and other interaction state;
- semantic results consumed by editor or compiler behavior;
- logical gaps used by caret movement and hit-testing; and
- display-row/source-row mappings used by navigation.

### The web UI render projection owns

- replaceable, render-ready data derived from editor state;
- syntax font transitions and resolved glyph sprite IDs; and
- snapshots that can be recalculated outside the draw loop.

### The renderer owns

- drawing to the target surface;
- frame-time inputs such as current WebAssembly memory values; and
- short-lived rendering resources that cannot be derived solely from editor state.

If a value is required for editor behavior, moving it into this package would make the projection authoritative and is
therefore the wrong boundary. If a value can be discarded and recreated without changing editor behavior, it is a
candidate for the render projection.

## Update Flow

`createWebUiRenderProjection(store, events)` creates a projection controller that:

1. reads the current editor state and sprite lookups;
2. subscribes to relevant state changes and lifecycle events;
3. derives a new `WebUiRenderData` snapshot outside the renderer;
4. exposes the current snapshot through `getSnapshot()`; and
5. removes its subscriptions through `dispose()`.

The web UI reads the latest snapshot while drawing code blocks. It does not calculate syntax highlighting or resolve
glyph sprite IDs during that draw.

```typescript
import { createWebUiRenderProjection } from '@8f4e/web-ui-render-projection';

const renderProjection = createWebUiRenderProjection(store, events);

const renderData = renderProjection.getSnapshot();
const codeCells = renderData.codeBlocks.get(codeBlockId)?.codeCells;

renderProjection.dispose();
```

## Data Model

```typescript
interface WebUiRenderData {
  codeBlocks: ReadonlyMap<number, CodeBlockRenderData>;
}

interface CodeBlockRenderData {
  codeCells: Array<Array<SpriteId | null>>;
}
```

`deriveCodeBlockCodeCells` and `resolveCodeCells` are also exported as pure building blocks. The language-specific
syntax highlighters remain internal implementation modules.

## Current Limitations

- Relevant changes currently recalculate every code block rather than structurally sharing unaffected records.
- State subscriptions are broad and are not yet coordinated by a transaction or committed-change boundary.
- Only code glyph preparation has moved into the projection so far; the web UI still reads editor-state for other
  layout and interaction data.
- Frame-time runtime values deliberately remain live renderer inputs rather than projected data.

These constraints are tracked in
[TODO 476](../../../../../../docs/todos/476-extract-web-ui-render-projection.md).
