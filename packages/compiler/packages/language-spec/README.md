# @8f4e/language-spec

`@8f4e/language-spec` contains shared language contracts and target-independent facts for the compiler pipeline.

This package is the place for data and types that describe the 8f4e language itself:

- AST, argument, diagnostic, cache, and compiled-output contracts.
- Instruction names, instruction specs, source argument shape rules, stack signatures, and instruction effects.
- Memory declaration types, memory regions, memory data contracts, and memory layout metadata types.
- Function type limits, function signature helpers, parameter shape metadata, and runtime option contracts.
- Compiler error codes and shared error metadata.

The package is intentionally declarative. Other compiler packages import these facts so they agree on the same language model.

This package does not own:

- Parsing source text into ASTs. That belongs to `@8f4e/tokenizer`.
- Project document parsing or include reduction. That belongs to `@8f4e/project-preparser`.
- Compiler pass orchestration. That belongs to `@8f4e/compiler`.
- Memory layout, constant resolution, memory reference resolution, default resolution, stack analysis, or code generation.
- WebAssembly byte encoding helpers or WASM-specific section construction.

When adding a new shared truth, prefer deriving it from an existing spec table when possible instead of creating a second source of truth.
