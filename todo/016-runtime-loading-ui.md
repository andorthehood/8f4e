# TODO: Runtime Loading UI Improvements

**Priority**: ðŸŸ¢  
**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 days  
**Created**: 2024-12-19  
**Status**: Open  

## Problem Description

After implementing lazy loading for runtimes (TODO: 015), users will experience a delay when switching between runtime types. Currently, there's no visual feedback during this loading process, which could lead to confusion about whether the system is working or has frozen.

**Current State**: No loading indicators or progress feedback during runtime switching.

**Why this is a problem**: 
- Users may think the system has crashed when switching runtimes
- No indication of loading progress or estimated time
- Poor user experience during runtime transitions
- Potential for user confusion about system state

**Impact**: Reduced user confidence, potential for multiple clicks/actions during loading, and overall degraded user experience.

## Proposed Solution

**High-level approach**: Implement loading states, progress indicators, and error handling UI components for runtime switching operations.

**Key changes required**:
- Create loading state management in the runtime system
- Add visual loading indicators during runtime initialization
- Implement progress tracking for runtime loading
- Add error states and recovery options for failed loads
- Ensure smooth transitions between loading and active states

**Alternative approaches considered**:
- Simple spinner only (rejected - insufficient feedback)
- Full-screen loading overlay (rejected - too intrusive)

## Implementation Plan

### Step 1: Loading State Management
- Extend runtime state to include loading status
- Add loading progress tracking capabilities
- Implement loading state transitions
- **Expected outcome**: Centralized loading state management
- **Dependencies**: TODO: 015 (lazy load runtimes) completion

### Step 2: Loading UI Components
- Create loading spinner/indicator component
- Implement progress bar for runtime initialization
- Add loading text with status messages
- **Expected outcome**: Reusable loading UI components
- **Dependencies**: Step 1 completion

### Step 3: Runtime Switching UI
- Integrate loading states with runtime switching
- Add loading overlay during runtime transitions
- Implement smooth state transitions
- **Expected outcome**: Seamless runtime switching experience
- **Dependencies**: Step 2 completion

### Step 4: Error Handling UI
- Create error state components
- Add retry mechanisms for failed loads
- Implement user-friendly error messages
- **Expected outcome**: Robust error handling with recovery options
- **Dependencies**: Step 3 completion

### Step 5: Testing and Polish
- Test loading states across different runtime types
- Verify smooth transitions and animations
- User testing for loading experience
- **Expected outcome**: Polished loading experience
- **Dependencies**: All previous steps

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Loading states clearly visible during runtime switching
- [ ] Progress indicators show loading progress when available
- [ ] Smooth transitions between loading and active states
- [ ] Error states provide clear feedback and recovery options
- [ ] Loading experience feels responsive and professional
- [ ] No visual glitches or jarring state changes

## Affected Components

- `packages/editor/src/state/effects/runtime.ts` - Loading state management
- `packages/editor/src/view/drawers/` - Loading UI components
- `packages/editor/src/state/types.ts` - Loading state type definitions
- `packages/editor/src/events/` - Loading event handling

## Risks & Considerations

- **Performance impact**: Loading animations shouldn't affect runtime performance
- **Accessibility**: Loading states must be accessible to screen readers
- **Mobile experience**: Loading UI should work well on touch devices
- **Dependencies**: Requires completion of lazy loading implementation
- **Breaking Changes**: None expected - purely additive UI improvements

## Related Items

- **Blocks**: None currently
- **Depends on**: TODO: 015 (Lazy Load Runtimes)

## Notes

- This work should only begin after TODO: 015 is completed
- Focus on creating a smooth, professional loading experience
- Consider accessibility requirements for loading states
- Loading animations should be subtle and not distracting
- Error states should provide clear next steps for users
