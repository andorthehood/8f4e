# TODO: Add 2D Engine Buffer Utilities Tests

**Priority**: ��
**Estimated Effort**: 3-4 hours
**Created**: 2025-08-28
**Status**: Completed
**Completed**: 2025-09-04

## Problem Description

The 2D engine package currently lacks comprehensive test coverage for its low-level buffer utility functions. These functions are critical for:
- Vertex buffer generation for rectangles, sprites, and lines
- Texture coordinate calculations for sprite rendering
- Mathematical accuracy of WebGL vertex data

Without tests, there's a risk of:
- Silent bugs in coordinate calculations
- Incorrect UV mapping that could break sprite rendering
- Performance issues from inefficient buffer operations
- Difficulty in refactoring or optimizing these core functions

## Proposed Solution

Implement comprehensive unit tests for all buffer utility functions in `packages/glugglug/src/utils/buffer.ts`:

- **`fillBufferWithRectangleVertices`**: Test vertex coordinate calculations and triangle formation
- **`fillBufferWithSpriteCoordinates`**: Test UV coordinate normalization and mapping
- **`fillBufferWithLineVertices`**: Test line rendering math and thickness handling

Use Jest as the testing framework (already configured in package.json) and create test fixtures with known inputs and expected outputs.

## Implementation Plan

### Step 1: Set up test infrastructure
- Create `packages/glugglug/tests/` directory
- Set up Jest configuration for the glugglug package
- Create test utilities for buffer validation

### Step 2: Test rectangle vertex generation
- Test `fillBufferWithRectangleVertices` with various dimensions
- Verify correct triangle formation (6 vertices, 2 triangles)
- Test edge cases (zero dimensions, negative coordinates)
- Test buffer offset handling

### Step 3: Test sprite coordinate generation
- Test `fillBufferWithSpriteCoordinates` with different sprite sizes
- Verify correct UV coordinate normalization
- Test edge cases (sprites at texture sheet boundaries)
- Test buffer offset handling

### Step 4: Test line vertex generation
- Test `fillBufferWithLineVertices` with different orientations
- Verify thickness calculations and perpendicular line math
- Test edge cases (horizontal/vertical lines, zero thickness)

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All buffer utility functions have >95% test coverage
- [ ] Tests cover normal cases, edge cases, and error conditions
- [ ] Tests verify mathematical accuracy of coordinate calculations
- [ ] Tests run successfully in CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Test suite provides clear error messages for failures

## Affected Components

- `packages/glugglug/src/utils/buffer.ts` - Main functions to be tested
- `packages/glugglug/tests/` - New test directory and files
- `packages/glugglug/jest.config.js` - Jest configuration (may need creation)
- `packages/glugglug/package.json` - Test script verification

## Risks & Considerations

- **Risk 1**: Floating-point precision issues in coordinate calculations
  - **Mitigation**: Use appropriate tolerance values for floating-point comparisons
- **Risk 2**: Complex mathematical edge cases in line rendering
  - **Mitigation**: Create comprehensive test fixtures covering various line orientations
- **Dependencies**: Jest configuration setup for the package
- **Breaking Changes**: None - tests are additive only

## Related Items

- **Blocks**: None
- **Depends on**: Jest configuration for glugglug package

## Notes

- Buffer utilities are pure mathematical functions, making them ideal for unit testing
- No WebGL mocking required - these functions work with standard JavaScript arrays
- Tests should focus on mathematical accuracy and buffer manipulation
- Consider creating visual test fixtures for manual verification of complex cases
- These tests will serve as a foundation for testing higher-level renderer components
