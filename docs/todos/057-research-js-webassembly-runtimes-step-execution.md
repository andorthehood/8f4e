# TODO: Research JavaScript/WebAssembly Runtimes for Step-by-Step Execution

## Problem Description

The 8f4e project currently uses WebAssembly for executing compiled code with basic debugging capabilities (debug instruction parser exists). To enhance the development experience and enable advanced debugging features, we need to research JavaScript/WebAssembly runtime options that can provide:

- **Step-by-step execution**: Ability to execute WASM instructions one at a time
- **Stack inspection**: Real-time visibility into the WASM execution stack
- **Breakpoint support**: Pause execution at specific points for debugging
- **Variable watching**: Monitor memory locations and variable values during execution

Currently, the project uses `wabt` for WASM-to-WAT conversion in testing, but lacks advanced runtime debugging capabilities for live code execution.

## Proposed Solution

Conduct comprehensive research on three specific JavaScript/WebAssembly runtime options to evaluate their suitability for integration into the 8f4e project:

1. **wabt.js** - WebAssembly Binary Toolkit JavaScript port
2. **webassemblyjs** - Pure JavaScript WebAssembly toolchain  
3. **ts-wasm-runtime** - TypeScript WebAssembly runtime implementation

For each option, evaluate:
- Integration feasibility with existing architecture
- Debugging and stack inspection capabilities  
- Performance implications for browser usage
- API surface complexity and maintainability
- Compatibility with current WASM compilation pipeline

## Implementation Plan

### Step 1: Research wabt.js Integration Feasibility
- Document current wabt usage in `packages/compiler/tests/instructions/testUtils.ts`
- Investigate wabt.js runtime execution capabilities beyond WAT conversion
- Evaluate if wabt can provide step-by-step execution hooks
- Assess integration complexity with existing runtime packages
- **Expected outcome**: Clear understanding of wabt.js debugging capabilities and integration path
- **Dependencies**: None

### Step 2: Investigate webassemblyjs Debugging Features  
- Research webassemblyjs architecture and execution model
- Evaluate built-in debugging and instrumentation capabilities
- Test step-by-step execution and stack inspection features
- Assess browser performance characteristics and bundle size impact
- Review API documentation for runtime hooks and execution control
- **Expected outcome**: Comprehensive analysis of webassemblyjs debugging potential
- **Dependencies**: Step 1 completion

### Step 3: Analyze ts-wasm-runtime Implementation
- Study TypeScript WebAssembly runtime architecture  
- Evaluate debugging hooks and execution control mechanisms
- Test integration feasibility with existing TypeScript codebase
- Assess performance compared to native WebAssembly execution
- Review type safety benefits and development experience improvements
- **Expected outcome**: Complete evaluation of TypeScript runtime benefits and limitations
- **Dependencies**: Step 2 completion

### Step 4: Performance and Browser Compatibility Analysis
- Benchmark execution performance vs native WebAssembly for each option
- Test browser compatibility across major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- Evaluate memory usage and startup time implications
- Assess impact on existing audio/MIDI real-time performance requirements
- **Expected outcome**: Performance comparison matrix and browser compatibility report
- **Dependencies**: Steps 1-3 completion

### Step 5: API Surface and Maintainability Comparison
- Document API complexity and learning curve for each option
- Evaluate long-term maintainability and community support
- Assess integration effort with existing runtime architecture
- Review debugging UI requirements and implementation complexity
- **Expected outcome**: Maintainability and integration effort assessment
- **Dependencies**: Steps 1-4 completion

### Step 6: Create Integration Recommendations
- Synthesize research findings into actionable recommendations
- Prioritize options based on feasibility, performance, and debugging capabilities
- Outline potential implementation phases and migration strategies
- Identify risks and mitigation strategies for top recommendations
- **Expected outcome**: Clear recommendation with implementation roadmap
- **Dependencies**: All previous steps completion

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Complete technical analysis of wabt.js debugging capabilities and current integration
- [ ] Thorough evaluation of webassemblyjs step-by-step execution features
- [ ] Comprehensive assessment of ts-wasm-runtime debugging hooks and TypeScript benefits
- [ ] Performance benchmark comparison across all three options
- [ ] Browser compatibility matrix documenting support and limitations
- [ ] API complexity and maintainability analysis for each runtime
- [ ] Clear recommendation with pros/cons and integration effort estimates
- [ ] Implementation roadmap for recommended solution(s)

## Affected Components

- `packages/compiler/tests/instructions/testUtils.ts` - Current wabt usage analysis
- `packages/runtime-*` - All runtime packages for integration assessment
- `packages/editor/src/state/effects/codeBlocks/codeBlockDecorators/debuggers/` - Debugging infrastructure
- `packages/editor/src/state/effects/runtime.ts` - Runtime initialization and management
- Future debugging UI components - New components for step-by-step execution interface

## Risks & Considerations

- **Risk 1**: Performance degradation with JavaScript-based WASM execution vs native
  - *Mitigation*: Thorough benchmarking and performance testing across use cases
- **Risk 2**: Browser compatibility issues with advanced debugging features  
  - *Mitigation*: Comprehensive browser testing and progressive enhancement strategy
- **Risk 3**: Complex integration with existing real-time audio/MIDI requirements
  - *Mitigation*: Focus on maintaining existing performance for production execution
- **Risk 4**: Increased bundle size and startup time with debugging runtime
  - *Mitigation*: Evaluate lazy loading and development-only debugging modes
- **Dependencies**: Understanding of existing WASM compilation pipeline and runtime architecture
- **Breaking Changes**: None expected for research phase; implementation may require runtime API changes

## Notes

- Current project already uses wabt for WAT conversion in tests, providing a foundation for expanded usage
- Existing debug instruction parser in editor suggests some debugging infrastructure is already in place  
- Real-time audio/MIDI performance requirements mean debugging features should be optional/development-only
- TypeScript codebase may benefit from ts-wasm-runtime's type safety features
- Research should consider both development-time debugging and educational/learning use cases
